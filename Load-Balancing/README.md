# Load Balancer Setup on Azure

## Introduction

A **Load Balancer** is a crucial component in distributed systems that ensures the optimal distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple servers. It enhances the availability, scalability, and performance of applications by ensuring no single server is overwhelmed with traffic, thus avoiding potential downtime or performance degradation.

### 1.1 Definition
A load balancer is a network device or software solution that balances traffic between servers, ensuring no server becomes a bottleneck.

### 1.2 Purpose
The load balancer ensures high availability and performance by distributing traffic across multiple servers and preventing overloads.

### 1.3 Benefits
- **Improved Scalability:** Allows horizontal scaling by adding servers as traffic increases.
- **High Availability:** Traffic is routed to healthy servers, ensuring fault tolerance.
- **Optimized Performance:** Balancing load prevents server overload, reducing response times.
- **Flexibility:** Load balancing configurations can be adjusted based on traffic patterns.

## Types of Load Balancers

### 2.1 Local Load Balancer
Operates within a data center or geographical location, managing traffic among servers within the same region.

### 2.2 Global Load Balancer
Directs traffic across multiple data centers, ensuring clients are connected to the nearest or best-performing server.

### 2.3 Hardware Load Balancer
A physical device dedicated to load balancing tasks, offering high performance.

### 2.4 Software Load Balancer
A software solution deployed on commodity hardware, offering flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

### 2.5 Application Load Balancer
Works at the application layer (Layer 7) and makes routing decisions based on HTTP headers or application-specific data.

## Why Use Load Balancers?

### 3.1 Scalability
By adding or removing servers as required, load balancers make scaling infrastructure easier.

### 3.2 High Availability
Load balancers ensure that if one server goes down, the traffic is redirected to healthy servers, maintaining availability.

### 3.3 Improved Performance
Load balancers distribute requests evenly, preventing server overload and improving response times.

### 3.4 SSL Termination
Offloads SSL decryption from the backend servers to improve performance.

## Load Balancer Solutions on Azure

### 4.1 Azure Load Balancer
A Layer 4 solution that distributes traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers.

### 4.2 Azure Application Gateway
An advanced, Layer 7 load balancer ideal for web applications, offering URL and host-based routing.

### 4.3 Azure Traffic Manager
A DNS-based global load balancer that routes traffic to the best-performing endpoint.

## Architecture of Load Balancer on Azure

### 5.1 Components
- **Frontend IP Configuration:** Defines public IP and port for incoming traffic.
- **Backend Pool:** Specifies the VMs or instances receiving traffic.
- **Health Probes:** Monitors backend health.
- **Load Balancer Rules:** Defines traffic distribution criteria.

### 5.2 Load Balancing Algorithms
- **Default (Round-Robin):** Traffic is distributed evenly.
- **Source IP:** Traffic from the same client IP is routed to the same server.
- **Source IP Affinity:** Ensures session persistence for clients.

### 5.3 Traffic Distribution Modes
- **Internet-facing:** Public-facing load balancers.
- **Internal:** Private load balancing within a network.

### 5.4 Availability Zones
Deployment across multiple zones ensures fault tolerance and availability.

### 5.5 Health Probes
Periodically checks the health of instances to route traffic only to healthy ones.

### 5.6 Backend Pool and Frontend IP Configuration
Defines how traffic is distributed and where it is received.

### 5.7 Load Balancer Rules
Specifies how traffic should be distributed based on port numbers, protocols, etc.

## Steps for Implementing a Load Balancer in Azure

1. **Create a Resource Group (LB-RG):**
   Create a new resource group and a virtual network (VNet) in this group. Rename the default subnet to "Subnet 1."

2. **Create Two Virtual Machines (VM1 and VM2):**
   - Select **Windows Server 2019** as the image and **Standard_D2s_v3** as the size.
   - VM1 and VM2 should be placed in **Subnet 1** of the **VNet**.

3. **Install IIS Server:**
   Open both VMs via RDP and install **IIS Server** on both.

4. **Edit IIS Default Page:**
   Go to `inetpub -> wwwroot` and modify the `iisstart.html` file. Add a unique identifier for each VM to track traffic.

5. **Create a Public Load Balancer:**
   Follow the provided steps and screenshots to create a load balancer that balances traffic across VM1 and VM2.

## Conclusion

The implementation of a load balancer in Azure ensures that traffic is efficiently distributed across multiple VMs, improving the performance and availability of your services. By leveraging Azure's powerful load balancing solutions, such as Azure Load Balancer, Application Gateway, and Traffic Manager, you can scale your infrastructure while ensuring minimal downtime and optimized performance for your applications.
